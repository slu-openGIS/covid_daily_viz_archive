One striking facet of the COVID-19 outbreak is the effect it has had on communities that have been historically been marginalized in the United States, including African Americans, indigenous nations (the Navajo Nation has one of the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/24/842945050/navajo-nation-sees-high-rate-of-covid-19-and-contact-tracing-is-a-challenge" target="_blank">highest infection rates in country</a>), and people incarcerated in jails/prisons. What ties these groups together is not inherent biological risk. Rather, disinvestment at the community level means the agencies and organizations that serve these communities often lack the resources needed to prevent the spread of infectious disease. This is long-standing social and health disparities that potentially leave individuals more susceptible to severe illness.

These plots show patterns in infections and mortality by race and ethnicity for the entirety of Missouri.

### Infections

```{r mo-infections, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}

### Mortality

### Data Table

```{r state-table, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
state_data %>%
  select(value, cases_est, case_rate, cases_pct) %>%
  mutate(
    cases_est = round(cases_est, digits = 0),
    case_rate = round(case_rate, digits = 2)
  ) %>%
  rename(
    Identity = value,
    `Estimated Count` = cases_est,
    `Per Capita Rate` = case_rate,
    `Percent of Total` = cases_pct
  ) -> data_table

DT::datatable(data_table, rownames= FALSE)
```

### Notes

  * The underlying data for these plots are available from [GitHub](faq.html#How_Do_I_Download_Your_Data) in the `mo_race_rates.csv` table, which is assembled from data provided by the [State of Missouri](faq.html#Where_Do_These_Data_Come_From).
  * The FAQ contains short explanations of [per-capita rates](faq.html#What_are_Per_Capita_Rates) and [log plots](faq.html#What_are_Log_Plots). Note that the rates presented for statewide data are per 100,000 individuals.
  * The State of Missouri does not release actual counts for individuals, so these rates are estimated using the current number of positive cases and the percentages provided by the State on their dashboard.
  * Rates for other racial identities are combined into an 'other' category, which cannot be easily converted to a rate and so is not included here.
  * The Latino category is not exclusive of the racial identities shown.
  * There is a significant amount of missing data, typically around 16% to 20% on a given day.
