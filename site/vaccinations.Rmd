This page contains vaccination data for Missouri, which are being reported by [the State on their dashboard](https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/data/). We use the term **vaccination initiated** to refer to the number of people who have received *at least* an initial dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines as well as those people who have received the single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. We use the term **vaccination completed** to refer to the number of people who have received *both* doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines as well as those people who have received the single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
