## Motivation
Chris Prener has been maintaining this site has been updated since March as a means for communicating information about the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Missouri. When the site was initially launched, the State of Missouri was not providing much in the way of data about the pandemic on the Department of Health and Senior Services website. Though that has changed to some degree, it also does not provide a comprehensive resource for data from Missouri. Moreover, their dashboard has a number of quirks, occasional problems, and does not always follow best practices for mapping or visualizing data. 

## What Makes This Site Unique? {.padtop}
Unlike other interactive maps being used to track the outbreak, the interactive maps include the counties in Illinois, Kansas, and Oklahoma that are part of Missouri's metropolitan areas. This is also true for the tables and static plots of data from metropolitan areas. The goal is to provide residents of Missouri's largest cities with a more comprehensive snapshot of the state of the outbreak in the area around them, even if it is across a state line. 

The site also integrates data from a number of other data sources that the State of Missouri does not provide on their dashboard. These include data about health disparities and hospitalizations in the St. Louis area, testing and infection data from surrounding states, and zip-code data for St. Louis as well.
