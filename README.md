This repository contains the data vizualization and website creation scripts that power for the [Missouri COVID-19 Tracking Project](http://slu-opengis.github.io/covid_daily_viz/). The data set creation scripts have been separated as part of the conversion of the original code into a more modular, better documented set of resources. They can now be found in the [`MO_HEALTH_Covid_Tracking`](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/MO_HEALTH_Covid_Tracking) repository.
